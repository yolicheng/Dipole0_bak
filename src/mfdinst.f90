subroutine mfdinst(ypo, tp, mmat, nmf, epsl, ymfd)
! Compute initial state of the unstable manifold, be the dominant eigenvalue
! The monodromy matrix is phi, use power method (gr_mpower) to compute the dominant eigenvector

! the initial state: 
! add a small perturbation on the PO with magnitude of epsl,  long the eigenvector at each point
! 
! 20160108 - modify for use in lorentz force case 
    
! 20150512  -- to f90 format - save ymfd to file ./dat/mfdInst.dat
! Modified to a more complete subroutine, with the initial condition and period, and number of 
! orbits on the manifold, compute the initial conditions for each orbit
 
 
! 20150409 -- Default as unstable manifold
!   The initial state y0 is for unstable manifold, it's approximated by
!   the state on the p.o. + a small perturbation(1d-6 is small enough) along the eigenvector
 
!   It's computed by dominant eigenvector, with the corresponding eigenvalue > 1 
! 
!    x0_wu = x0_po + epsl* vep/vepm

!  Note: 
!    The direction vep must be normalized to unit vector, to keep the perturbation 
!    on different orbits of the same magnitude

!  Input Variable:
!     ypo(6)   the initial point on the p.o.(x,y,z,vx,vy,vz)
!     nmf      number of orbits computed on the manifold   
!     epsl     the  displacement of the initial condition along the vector field to compute manifold 
!              1.d-6 as default 
 
!  Output Variable
!       ymfd(nmf,6) the initial state (6-dimension) for the orbits on mfd

!  idea-- the first way suggested by Gerard
!     use the STM to compute the final perturbation from the eigenvector, 
!     do not need to discrete the p.o., and compute the monodromy matrix
!     for each point

! 20150525 --- thorough check of this subroutine  -ckd!
!     including phi update and perturbation modulus rm

!calculate the eigenvector of the initial point on p.o. 
! Reference:
!    Dynamics and Mission Design Near Libration Points, Volume 3, P96, 
!    4.2 local approximation of stable manifold.

! The eigenvector is scaled in such a way that the three components of these vectors 
! relative to the position have Euclidean norm equal to one. So that we write as:
! vep = vep / sqrt(vep(1)**2 + vep(1)**2 + vep(1)**2  )
!  
!  In this way if we want to take initial conditions at a selected physical distance from 
!  point ymfd(i,:) which is in the p.o., we only have to multiply vep by the selected 
!  distance in km with the desired sign.

!The nature of ε has a large impact on creating the manifolds. The value must be small to correctly compute the manifolds, but too small a value will result in very lengthy computation times. While technically the correctness of the manifolds is approached asymptotically as ε shrinks to zero, in practice ε need only be small relative to the mass parameter of the system.
! In practice, a value on the order of 1.d-4 is used for the Earth-Moon system, 
!   1d-6 is used for the Sun-Earth system [13].

!Another consideration is the difference between position and velocity perturbations. While ε is often given in standard distance units – i.e. 1000 km in the Sun-Earth system – a perturbation of similar magnitude would be huge for the velocity terms. In order to correctly scale the position perturbation, we propose the following:
!eq9
!where R and V are the position and velocity vectors. Since each has a time dependence, it is important to scale the perturbation correctly at each point. This process is used to create perturbed initial conditions in the function manifold_mono.m.

! For velocity, the perturbation is defined as. 
! Update 20150602--- the perturbation is 1.d-6, both for position and velocity

! To calculate the eigenvector at each discreted point along the p.o., 
! No need to compute the Monodromya matrix each time. Compute one time 
! is enough, just at the initial point. Treat vep as a small perturbation, 
! the following vep can be obtained through the State Transit Matrix, which
! is computed along with integration of the state by setting n=42.
